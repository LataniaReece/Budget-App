# Budget App

[Full Site](https://latania-budget-app.netlify.app/). A responsive budget app using react-chartjs-2 and @mui/x-data-grid for data presentation. 

This app was built with React + TypeScript using Context API for state management. Select components are also backed by robust unit tests.

# What I Learned

For this project, my objective was to create an application that emphasizes charts and effective data presentation. To achieve this, I opted to use react-chartjs-2 for chart rendering, considering its popularity within the React community and my interest in exploring its documentation and features. Additionally, I chose to use @mui/x-data-grid, as I was already familiar with Material-UI but wanted to get into the specifics of muiâ€™s data-grid. 

Following my [previous project](https://github.com/LataniaReece/MediaDB), I wanted to continue on in developing my understanding in  Context API and Typescript, recognizing these as important skills for my developer career. I also included unit tests in this project to continue my learning in writing meaningful and robust tests in my apps for better stability.
